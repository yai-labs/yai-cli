# YAI CLI API (Contracts)

These docs are generated from the public headers and CLI sources in this repo.
They describe the CLI-facing contracts and how commands map to the control plane.

Quick links:
- `include/`
- `src/`
- `docs/COMMANDS.md`

Normative note:
If CLI behavior disagrees with `yai-specs`, the CLI is wrong.
