# Governance

## Repository Governance

- `CONTRIBUTING.md` defines contribution rules.
- `SECURITY.md` defines security reporting policy.
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` defines collaboration standards.
- `CHANGELOG.md` tracks notable changes.

## Contract Discipline

When behavior depends on contract changes, coordinate with `yai-specs` and document compatibility impact.
