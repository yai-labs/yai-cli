# Contributing

## Rules

- Keep changes small and atomic.
- Use descriptive commit messages.
- Do not modify C sources/headers/tests unless explicitly requested by maintainers.
- Keep CLI behavior aligned with pinned `yai-specs` contracts.

## Pull Requests

- Explain intent and impact.
- Mention compatibility considerations.
- Update docs when public behavior or usage changes.

## Contract Discipline

If a change depends on normative spec updates, coordinate with `yai-specs` first.
